# Java-compilation-reference
A small repo where I keep examples of building a project in java and the use of the ant build system. 

This is a reference project, as I work on new projects I like to go back to first principles, instead of getting bogged down in build configurations I wanted to try out different build configurations manually first, before working on more complex examples.   

The examples make heavy use of the ant manual: https://ant.apache.org/manual/tutorial-HelloWorldWithAnt.html

In each of the subfolders there is a seperate readme. 

| Folder       |    Description           |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| [Hello world - compiling](https://github.com/Reesy/java-compilation-reference/tree/master/1_hello_world) |  Most basic example, purely running the java compiler through cli | 
| [Hello world - JAR file ](https://github.com/Reesy/java-compilation-reference/tree/master/2_hello_world_jar) | "hello, world" example compiled to a JAR file through cli |
| [Hello world - Ant](https://github.com/Reesy/java-compilation-reference/tree/master/3_hello_ant) | "hello, world" example compiled using the ANT build tool! |
